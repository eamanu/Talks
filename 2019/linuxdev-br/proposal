**Title:**
Libcamera: freedom of cameras

**Type of submission:**
Lightning talks (5 minutes)

**Language:**
English

**Abstract:**
Cameras needs heavy hardware to image processing and this is based
on advanced algorithms that, on embedded device, it run into CPU
to save cost. In the absence of a clear limit between camera devices
and Linux-based system, the only option is use a closed-source software.
For that reason the Linux Media Community start a develop
of a camera stack that will be open-source-friendly. Libcamera is not
a monolithic library, it expose multiple components through its public
API towards upper layers. All this components are develop with
the propose to be Independent Camera Devices library.
In this lightning talk the speaker will introduce to libcamera
architecture with the propose to give to know this develop
to the community.
